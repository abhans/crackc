# C-practices
I've used the C programming language several times on my projects (for embedded and FPGA programming courses that I've taken)

I always wanted to explore C deeper so that I can become a better programmer and also a better engineer.

This repository is created to store my practices on C language including various `.c` files and possibly few projects that I've worked on.
You can find the main scripts at `src` directory.

I've also included notes on my studying sessions at `docs` that includes notes on the first chapter of the book titled `The C Programming Language`.
For the rest of the notes, contact me. I will consider it.

You might also find some C++ scripts here in there, mostly because I like to use both when prototyping.
